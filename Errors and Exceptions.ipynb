This means that code will only be parsed as it is run. Some environments will highlighted code with incorrect syntax or other potential problems before the code is run. This is called \"linting\". However, the main way you will find out if a section of your code has a problem is when the code is run. \n","\n","You've probably already seen some error messages, but in this notebook you'll learn a little more about them, how to deal with them and (in the extension) how to raise your own exceptions and use them in your program."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WEuSL5vQibn2"},"source":["## The Anatomy of an Error\n","When a piece of Python code executes in a way that breaks a rule of that piece of code, Python will raise an \"exception\". This means that, unless the error is \"handled\" (more on this later), the immediate piece of code running will cease and control will revert to the calling piece of code. If the error is not handled in that piece of code, it will also stop running and control will revert to the calling piece of code and so on. If you haven't used any error-handling, this means your entire code will stop running. This reversion of control to higher and higher level pieces of code is why it is called \"raising\" and error. \n","\n","Let's try an example of that with this simple example: "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fB_Urof8kQay"},"source":["def divide(a,b):\n","  return(a/b)\n","\n","print(divide(10,0))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"W3bPuCx4kcwf"},"source":["We see that the first line says \"ZeroDivisionError\". This is the type of exception that's been raised (see the next section for more details) and gives us a rough idea of what's happened. \n","\n","The message then provides a \"Traceback\". This shows us the path through the code that the exception has been raised through. We see here that it was raised in line 4 where we tried to print the result of our function ```divide```. The next part of the message tells us that the exception came from the ```divide``` function. Next, it shows which line it came from: it's line 2 where we return the result of ```a``` divided by ```b```. Finally it tells us the type of the exception again and a short description: \"division by zero\". So it seems that we've divided by zero and the division operator in Python has raised an exception as this operation produces an undefined result for a denominator of zero. \n","\n","By examining the error message in this way it's possible to understand where an error message has come from and roughly what has caused it, even in a large and complex program. This gives you the basic information you need to start working out how to fix the problem.\n","\n","It's worth remembering that exceptions will only be raised if the code you've written breaks a rule of Python. Exceptions will not be raised if you're code is syntactically valid and no values of variables during execution cause an exception to be raised, your code will run. This is no guarantee that the code does what you want or intend it to. This is the area of debugging and is worthy of a course in itself.
