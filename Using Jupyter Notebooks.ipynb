For larger codes you may wish to use Python in a stand-alone environment such as a traditional IDE. But for demonstration purposes Jupyter is a very useful tool.\n","\n","Notebook files have the extension \".ipynb\" extension. A Jupyter notebook is one of many environments you may run Python code.  Colab and the Jupyter notebook editor in Anaconda are two of the many pieces of software you may use to write and run a Jupyter notebook. For this course we recommend using the online Google Colab tool, but you can use Anaconda to run the notebooks on your own machine within an internet connection. On college computers, Jupyter can be used by launchng Anaconda from the Software Hub Apps Anywhere interface. \n","\n","Note that exact interfaces will differ between different environments but the same functionality should be found in most environments. This course will be using the Colab environment."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"br4ThcjVNBfb"},"source":["## Cells and Executing Code\n","\n","A notebooks is made up of one or more \"cells\". Cells can contain the html-like text used to generate text or code to be run by the user. A cell containing a piece of code may be recognised by the the  ```[]```  to the left of it. Code in these blocks can be run in a nubmer of ways. The simplest is click on the ```[ ]``` . This will execute the code.

This is the output of the code, which has been printed to the screen. You may also have noticed a number appear between the square brackets to the left of the code snippet. This indicates the order in which the code snippet has been executed. Code cells may be executed in any order and variables will be saved between execution of code snippets. To try this, execute the three codes snippets below in the following order:\n","- 1\n","- 2\n","- 3\n","- 2"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"eAE233GJvuG4"},"source":["a=\"Message 1\""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dt9NlZYyvuG6"},"source":["print(a)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PZUIOI-ZvuG8"},"source":["a=\"Message 2\""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eCXAZCPzNUWr"},"source":["The first time you ran code snippet 1 you should have seen \"Message 1\" as the output and the second time the output should have been \"Message 2\".

This should be the case for the notebooks that form part of this course. In this case you can select \"Save a Copy in Drive\" from the \"File\" menu to create a new copy that is yours and yo can edit.\n","\n","For this course, it is reccommended that you create two copies. One of these should be the original copy without your edits, and another which you can edit to compelte exercises or expierment."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CSpv_w2nvuG-"},"source":["## Basic Jupyter Commands\n","\n","Jupyter contains a number of useful tools for executing these cells. By using the \"Runtime\" menu, you can run multiple cells at a time using \"Run all\", \"Run before\", \"Run selected\" and \"Run after\".\n","\n","You can clear output (this is the term for what is written under a code cell when it's executed) by clicking on the symbol to the left of it. You can clear all outputs from the notebook using the \"Clear All Outputs\" command on the \"Edit\" menu. Clearing the output will not unset variables set by the code snippets run, only remove the output printed to the screen.\n","\n","To unset variables, use the \"Restart Runtime\" or \"Reset Runtime\" option in the Runtime menu. The \"Interrupt Execution\" command on the kernel menu will halt the procesing of code, which can be useful if you've accidentally written a piece of code that will never finish executing or if the code is taking too long to execute.\n","\n","The \"insert\" menu allows you to create new cells. The \"cell type\" option in the \"cell\" menu allows you toggle the current cell type between the different cell types available:\n","- **Code**: Code snippets\n","- **Text**: The html-like language used to generate text, tables, equations, etc.\n","\n","Alternatively, you can hover your mouse in the space after a cell and add a code or text cell there.\n","\n","###Exercise\n","\n","Try each of these commands from the different menus for yourself on this  notebook and ensure they behave as you would expect."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RY8lQr8RNgnL"},"source":["## Text Cells in Jupyter\n","You can include all sort so information in Jupyter text cells to obtain different effects. To see how each of the following examples is generated, double click on this cell.

In your example of it in your exercise, try writing something very simple instead. If it looks like a simple algebraic expression, it will probably render how you intend.\n","\n","### Code Snippets\n","You can write snippets of code in a text cell and they will be highlighted as if they were code written in a code cell. This can be useful for demonstrating a code feature in a textual way. For example: \n","\n","```python\n","print (\"Hello World\")\n","```\n","\n","There is not a way to run this code, it is merely normal text highlighted to look like code. The \"python\" which precedes the code itself tells Jupyter which language you are writing the code snippet in so it can be highlighted accorindly.\n","\n","In some environments, text cells may also be referred to as \"markdown\" cells.\n","\n","###Exercise\n","Try creating simple versions of each of the constructs above in a new text cell below this one."]}]}
