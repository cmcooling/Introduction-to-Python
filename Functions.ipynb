They provide a means of storing and naming a pieces of code that may be called repeatedly and in many different contexts.

Many functions return a value. If you want to store this value, you may assign the function call to a variable.

In many cases, these will be highlighted by your Jupyter notebook or wherever you are typing your Python.

You've probably already used some of these.\n","\n","| Function |  Description |\n","|------|-------|\n","| ```abs(x)``` | Returns the absolute value of the numeric variable ```x``` |\n","| ```all(x)``` | Returns True if all values of the collection ```x``` are True and False if not |\n","| ```any(x)``` | Returns True if any value of the collection ```x``` are True and False if not |\n","| ```float(x)``` | Returns a float version of the numeric variable ```x``` |\n","| ```input(x)``` | Prompts a user for an input with the string ```x``` and returns the entered value as a string |\n","| ```len(x)``` | Returns the number of items in a collection ```x``` |\n","| ```max(x)``` | Returns the maximum value in a collection ```x``` |\n","| ```min(x)``` | Returns the minimum value in a collection ```x``` |\n","| ```print(x)``` | Prints a representation of the variable ```x``` to the standard output of the device |\n","| ```str(x)``` | Returns a representation of ```x``` as a string |\n","| ```sum(x)``` | Returns the sum of a collection ```x``` |\n","| ```type(x)``` | Returns the type of the variable ```x``` |\n","\n","When you define your own functions, it is highly recommended to not define functions with the same name as an intrinsic function unless you have a very specific goal in mind that necessitates it.\n","\n","Below is an example which combines a number of intrinsic functions:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"94rzFYUg8Phy"},"source":["name=input(\"What's your name? \")\n","print(\"Nice to meet you \" + name)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ja7wSNAtsFBb"},"source":["## Defining Your Own Functions\n","To define your own function, the basic syntax is:\n","\n","```python\n","def function_name(arg1, arg2, ...):\n","  [What the function does]\n","  [May span multiple lines]\n","  return(x)\n","\n","```\n","\n","The ```def``` statement tells Python you are about to define a function. The function name is the same as the command you will type to call the function. It has the same restrictions as the restrictions for variable names. It's advisable to give your functions descriptive and unique names so you easily understand what your function does when you see it being called in the text.\n","\n","In it's simplest form, the list of arguments is the name of the variables the functions requires as an input when the function is called. Note that this does not need to be the same as the name of the variables passed to the function when it is called (see the example below). Arguments are separated by commas and the order of variables in a function call maps them to the arguments in the same order in the function definition.\n","\n","After the argument list, a colon is used before the body of the function is included in an indented block. You can include loops, conditionals and so in the block using different levels of indentation.\n","\n","The return statement is optional in a function. This allows you to determine what the returned value of the function is, i.e. the value ```result``` will have in the following function call:\n","\n","```python\n","result=function_name(arg1, arg2, ...)\n","```\n","If an execution of your function reaches the end of the indented block without a return statement being called, the value ```None``` will be returned instead. When the execution of a function reaches a ```return()``` statement, the execution of the function will end and the execution of the code will return to after the call of the function. A function may contain multiple ```return()``` statements, for example within a conditional block.\n","\n","Any variables defined within a function are defined only in the \"scope\" of that function (i.e. within the indented block) and will be discarded once the function has finished. This means they cannot be referenced outside the function.
