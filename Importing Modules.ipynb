This is useful because it allows code to be separated into logical related grouping which can be thought about and developed separately. It also means a module which relates a certain set of functionalities can be created and then used in a number of different projects with minimal effort. There are many modules which are built into your distribution of Python and many more can be acquired through the installation of packages.\n","\n","This concept is lost a little in a Jupyter notebook, but it is important once you start producing large codes as it will be impractical to contain your code in a single file."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nCYdILo1dQkA","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## \"Vanilla\" Python Modules\n","Python has a large number of modules which can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/py-modindex.html).
